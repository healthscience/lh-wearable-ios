The app requires minimum of iOS 10.

## Using the app

The app automatically scans for Mio PAI and Wahoo TICKR heart rate monitors.

When first using the app please press the Settings button and enter a name to track your data on the server and your date of birth for setting the heart rate zones.

Use the Send Data button on the main screen to send the data.

In the View Data screen the timestamp colours are as follows:

* Red indicates data hasnâ€™t been sent to the server
* Orange indicates data is queued for sending to the server
* Green indicates data has been sent to the server.

Swipe left or right on the dates at the top to move between weeks. Pressing a date shows data captured for that day.
